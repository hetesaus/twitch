# TwitchViewer
Allows you too view multiple streams at the same time, while having focus on 1 stream. Basicly squad streaming but you can choose who's in the squad. When switching streams it will mute the other channels and put them at a lower resolution. Use the "channels" parameter in the url to select channels. As example (https://hetesaus.github.io/twitchViewer/twitch.html?channels=1+2+3+4)
