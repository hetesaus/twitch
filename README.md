# Twitch Viewer
Allows you too view multiple streams at the same time, while having focus on 1 stream. Basicly squad streaming but you can choose who's in the squad. When switching streams it will mute the other channels and put them at a lower resolution. Use the "channels" parameter in the url to select channels.
